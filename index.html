                        <p>“During the average day of jumping through hoops of coding, the amount of stress is unbelievable for me  even coming from someone that has prior military experience, due to it being in such a different  realm of problem solving. Half a lifetime later, I've found that Roller Skating/ Roller blading is an amazing coping mechanism for my overwhelming amount of stress.
                        It allows me to learn new skills from physical balance to metal leaps of being able to recreate what I see others doing, but in my own style. The best part is there isn't a right or wrong way to express how YOU S KATE! Who knows, you may learn to love it as well”

                        <p>“Crafting is a great way to take your mind off of your worries. Scrolling on your favorite social media app is a very common way to distract yourself. But unfortunately that can lead to long periods of time disappearing and you being left feeling unproductive and guilty. Crafting is just as much of a time consumer. Having a tangible object as a result of your time, somehow feels very satisfying. The actual act of using your hands to create something can be therapeutic. It is a way of turning off a certain part of the brain and giving it a break. When it comes to school there are many things you are learning, and maybe struggling to learn. But having the feeling of accomplishment from working on a crafting project gives you that vote of confidence to put you in a positive headspace. So when you go back to your original stressor, you are going in with a refreshed mindset.  Here are some links on how to get started on making your own doll!”</p>

                        <p>”Often times when stress becomes overwhelming, I find myself escaping to the world of games. In games, I can free myself momentarily and explore a world beyond the stress that I experience in my life. I can be someone else, somewhere else and whenever else. The relief may be momentary, but sometimes taking a step back and away to reset for the next day is the key to relieving mental stress. “</p>

                        <h4>Exercising</h4>
                        <p>“Exercise is a powerful antidote to stress, acting like a pressure release valve for your body's built-up tension. When you work out, your brain releases endorphins, natural mood lifters that counteract stress hormones like cortisol. Physical activity also stimulates the production of serotonin and dopamine, boosting your mood and promoting relaxation. Beyond the chemical benefits, focusing on a workout provides a welcome distraction from daily worries, giving your mind a break. Plus, achieving fitness goals, big or small, can enhance your confidence and sense of accomplishment. Exercising strengthens your body and equips you with a vital tool for managing stress more effectively.”
